## Zero Inbox

[Method description](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero#:~:text=Inbox%20Zero%20is%20a%20rigorous,by%20productivity%20expert%20Merlin%20Mann.&text=Don't%20leave%20the%20email,the%20top%20of%20each%20hour.)

!!! Info "Email tips"
    * Don't leave the email client open.
    * Process email periodically throughout the day, perhaps at the top of each hour.
    * First delete or archive as many new messages as possible.
    * Then forward what can be best answered by someone else.
    * Immediately respond to any new messages that can be answered in two minutes or less.
    * Move new messages that require more than two minutes to answer -- and messages that can be answered later -- to a separate "requires response" folder.
    * Set aside time each day to respond to email in the "requires response" folder or chip away at mail in this folder throughout the day.
