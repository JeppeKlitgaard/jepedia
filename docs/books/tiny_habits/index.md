Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg, PhD @ Stanford

!!! Example "The Maui Method"
    After I ...

    > Wake up and put my feet on the floor

    I will ...

    > say _"It's going to be a great day"_

## The Anatomy of a Habit

1. **Anchor** - Anchor Moment

    Existing routine

2. **Behaviour** - New Tiny Behaviour

    The new behaviour (but made tiny)

3. **Celebration** - Instant Celebration

    Create positive emotions

    -> Exploit brain chemistry
   
!!! Note "Above and beyond"
    Doing anything more than the tiny behaviour is to be considered going above and beyond.

!!! Note "Brain chemistry"
    __People change best by feeling good, not by feeling bad.__
