# Chapter 2 - Motivation

## The Motivation Monkey

* Motivation is unreliable

## The PAC Person

Motivation comes from:

* Person: You want to do the action
* Action: External benefit or punishment for doing the action
* Context: Motivation caused by context

Motivation comes and goes (__The Motivation Wave__).

## Motivation types

An enduring motivation can be referred to as an __aspiration__.

!!! Note "Aspiration"
    Aspirations are abstract in nature and should thus be distinguished from __behaviours__.
    
## Aspirations vs outcomes vs behaviours

* Aspirations are _abstract desires_
* Outcomes are _measureables_.
* Behaviours are _something you can do **right now** or **at a specific point in time**_.

!!! Tip "How > Why"
    For making habits the _how_ is more important than the _why_.

## Steps to find the right behaviours

1. Clarify aspirations

    Make aspirations as clear as possible

2. Explore behaviour options
    
    Do a __Swarm of B's__
    
    Make use of __Magic Wanding__ (no behaviour is unrealistic)
    
    !!! Example "Categories for Magic Wanding"
        
        * What behaviours would you do one time?
        * What new habits would you create?
        * What habit would you stop?
    
    __Make sure your behaviours are super specific and actionable.__

3.  Match with Specific Behaviours
    
    !!! Tip "Golden Behaviours"
        The best matched behaviours are called __Golden Behaviours__:
            
        * __Impact__ - The behaviour is effective in realising your aspiration
        * __Motivation__ - You want to do the behaviour
        * __Ability__ - You can do the behaviour
    
    Use __Focus Mapping__ to find _Golden Behaviours_.
